# **DataViz Palettes**

DataViz Palettes is a tool to quickly see how different color palettes would play out on actual graph elements. You can define and modify your own palettes or import them from your favourite palette generation tool.
<br>

## Setup
Currently, DataViz Palettes is only available to play around with at the [Github Pages site](https://schubert-da.github.io/dataviz-palette-tool/) with no download or sign-in required.

## Usage

## Adding and Modifying Colors
The color palette bar contains your current color selection. The last color in this selection will act as the background for all the charts. In this panel you may add or remove colors, or modify them as needed.

---
**Note**: in the current version, certain graphs don't contain enough elements to showcase more than 6 colors.

## Importing Colors
Using the "Import colors" button you may enter a list of comma or space-separated hex values. 
This feature **only supports hex values** so a [conversion](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp) will be needed for other colors formats. However, you are still able to use other formats directly in the main color palette panel.

Examples of valid imports:
```
- #e9e4db, #a84d37, #c8a582, #4e4c49, #ab8359
- #e9e4db #a84d37 #c8a582 #4e4c49 #ab8359 // separating with space only is fine
- ece5e5 b92635 721d21 352324 ba9a9d // The '#' for each hex value is also optional
```
---
**Pro tip**: The import list will always reflect the current palette, so you can copy this as a quick means of exporting your palette.
